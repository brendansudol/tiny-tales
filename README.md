Tiny Tales is a small, playful space for young storytellers. Kids speak their idea for each
page, and our friendly AI turns those words into pictures.

Books live in the browser by default. When you hit share, the story is uploaded
to a temporary serverless store and you get a link to send around. Offline
creation still works just the same.
